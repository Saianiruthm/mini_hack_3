# World Happiness Report Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze the World Happiness Report dataset to uncover insights into global happiness trends. The analysis is conducted using Python's Pandas for data processing and analysis, and Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises annual reports from 2015 to 2019, with each report containing data on various factors contributing to happiness scores across different countries. The factors include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

## Analysis Areas

### 1. Factors Influencing Happiness Scores:
   - Analyzed the impact of different factors on overall happiness scores through scatter plots.
   
### 2. Regional Happiness Disparities:
   - Explored regional disparities in happiness scores and identified commonalities or differences in contributing factors among regions.

### 3. Trends Over Time:
   - Examined how happiness scores have changed over time for different countries, identifying significant trends and patterns.

### 4. Correlation Analysis:
   - Conducted correlation analysis to determine relationships between happiness scores and other variables such as GDP per capita, social support, etc.

### 5. Government Policies and Happiness:
   - Investigated the role of government policies in promoting happiness using trust in government as a proxy, and analyzed regional variations in trust.

### 6. Demographic Analysis:
   - Explored how demographic factors correlate with happiness scores, if applicable.

## Files

- `analyze_happiness.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis code.
- `2015.csv` to `2019.csv`: Datasets containing the World Happiness Report data for respective years.

## Instructions

1. Ensure you have Python and necessary libraries installed (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn).
2. Download the dataset files (`2015.csv` to `2019.csv`) and place them in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open and run the `analyze_happiness.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter or any compatible environment.
4. Follow along with the analysis code and visualizations to explore the insights.

## Results

The analysis reveals various insights into global happiness trends, including factors influencing happiness scores, regional disparities, trends over time, correlation between variables, and the role of government policies.

## Future Work

Future iterations of this analysis could delve deeper into specific aspects such as demographic trends, further explore the impact of government policies, and incorporate additional datasets for comprehensive insights.
